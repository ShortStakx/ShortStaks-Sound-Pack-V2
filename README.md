# Welcome to V2 # 
Everything here is free of use, if you have any suggestions or want to also be a contributor, let me know by dming me on discord shortstak_.
Everything in the General folder is recorded by me personally, and with the Guns folder most of it being a mixture of my recordings and different audio librarys that record the guns.
This repository contains the most up to date sound effects that I have recorded/designed (that I own the rights to) to be used on NON COMMERCIAL projects

If you need this for commerical use, let me know so I can help you out with the complications of it
