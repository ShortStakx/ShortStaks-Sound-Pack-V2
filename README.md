# Welcome to V2 # 
Everything here is free of use, if you have any suggestions or want to also be a contributor, let me know by dming me on discord shortstak_.
Everything in the General folder is recorded by me personally, and with the Guns folder most of it being a mixture of my recordings and different audio librarys that record the guns.

## Libraries Used ##
- Boom Library
- Pro Sound Effects
- Krotos

## Regarding the copyright, I allow this designed library I've made to be used on non-commerical projects, if you are going to use this library for commercial uses, please dm me on discord and ask for permission. ## 
# Please Give Proper Credit If You Do Choose To Use This Audio Pack in Any Project! "ShortStak". #
if you need my real name for any commerical projects, please ask me on discord as well.

Edit:
Some stuff had to be removed/redone because aftertouch audio's terms of service does not allow me to redesign their libraries and distribute it for free
